Face-to-Face Session Date Element for Custom Certificate
========================================================

Show the start start or end date of a face-to-face session on a certificate
generated by [the custom certificate plugin](https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_customcert) plugin for Moodle.

Prerequisites
-------------
The [Face-to-Face plugin](https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_facetoface/) must be
installed to use this plugin.

Use
---
Add the element *Face-to-face session date* to the certificate.

Select the face-to-face instance from the list of those available in the course.

Select whether to use the session start time or end time for the date.
Typically these will be the same date with a different time.

Students must have fully attended the session for the date to appear on the
certificate. If a student has attended more than one session of the same
face-to-face activity then the one with the latest end time is used.
